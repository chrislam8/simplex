# simplex
# This project is meant to be able to complete the simplex algorithm for canonical linear programming problems.

Update July 11, 2019: Added tests for negative inputs

Update July 5, 2019: Testing of the simplex algorithm has begun, ahead of projected date. No issues found so far.

Update July 2, 2019: The debugging tools have been updated to faciliate easier and quicker testing. Testing of the simplex algorithm implementation will start July 9th.

Update June 25, 2019: The simplex algorithm has been implemented in the header file. The algorithm implementation will be tested over the next few days.
